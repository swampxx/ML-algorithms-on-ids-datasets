# Comparative evaluation of ML algorithms on intrusion detection datasets

## Proposal

For the past few years, it has been seen that the computer intrusion attacks are becoming
more sophisticated, and the volume, velocity, and variance of traffic data have greatly
increased. Because the conventional methods and tools have become impotent in the
detection of intrusion attacks, most intrusion detection systems now embrace the use of
machine learning tools and algorithms for efficiency. This is because of their ability to
process large volume, velocity, and very high variance data. We will review and analyze the
performance of commonly used machine learning algorithms in network intrusion. The
performance of selected algorithms were evaluated as they were being trained and tested
with selected dataset from Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity datasets
(​ https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/index.html​ ) . These classification algorithms will be
evaluated based on their precision, sensitivity, and accuracy.
